Travelling Salesman problem is a famous problem in computer science. In this problem, there is a salesman who wants to travel a number of cities for sales purpose. The problem is to minimise his/her path cost. Output should be a sequence of cities travelled and the starting and ending city should be same. Also he/she should not pass through a city more than once. Visit `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Travelling_salesman_problem` to know more about TSP.

This program solves this problem using `genetic algorithm`. Visit `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm` to know more about genetic algorithm. As genetic algorithm is a local search technique, so output is not an optimal solution. Rather it is a solution giving the minimum path cost among the few states considered in given time.
